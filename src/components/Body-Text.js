                <p>Making its second March Madness run in a row, the Miami Hurricanes (21-11) look to face the Michigan State Spartans (19-14) tonight. Key wins against North Carolina, Virginia and Duke prior to the ACC Tournament show that the Canes have the potential to make a decent run in the NCAA Tournament. </p>
                <p>Up to this point, top scorers for the Canes have been senior guard Davon Reed, junior guard Ja’Quan Newton and freshman guard Bruce Brown. For more stats about the team, check out the slider below.</p>
